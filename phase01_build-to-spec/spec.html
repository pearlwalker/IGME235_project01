                    <h3>What was thought to be an abandoned nuclear shelter  turns out to be the family home of 
                        the ANDRADE family.</h3>

                    Mr. & Mrs. Andrade (names and ages unknown) 
                    moved to the property, where they then had a litter 
                    of two (Rui Andrade, male, 8; Marielle Andrade, 
                    female, 8 years old). The couple raised their litter through 
                    young adulthood while on the property, when the daughter 
                    seems to have moved out. Rui remained 
                    on the property after the death of the 
                    original homeowners as the bunker’s sole occupant.
                    <br><br>
                    Before moving back onto the property, 
                    Marielle Andrade allegedly attempted to bring criminal 
                    charges against her ex-partner before the case was dropped. 
                    The alleged charges include: Domestic and Economic Abuse, 
                    Assault and Battery, Improper Disclosure of Medical Records, 
                    Medical Fraud Conspiracy, and Wrongful Death of a Newborn. 
                    Prosecution was not able to prove intent or liability 
                    on the part of the defendant, leading to the court 
                    dropping the case.
                    <br>Marielle Andrade moved back to the bunker 
                    this summer. Shortly after, she adopted an abandoned 
                    kitten (Liz Andrade, female, less than 1yrs), bringing the 
                    property’s total occupants to 3 cats. Currently, she 
                    and her brother are raising the child. Local 
                    pediatrician Marcos Oliviera (male, 6yrs), 
                    the cat who informed local government of the 
                    property’s status, seemed concerned about the 
                    health and wellbeing of the child.

                    “[The sore on her face] looked like juvenile FIV. 
                    And there’s no way she’s being given proper 
                    treatment out there, there are no doctors 
                    in the woods.”
